Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was an organization that wanted to provide an environment for those learning how to drive. The user will have access to taking quizzes, practice tests, schedule driving time
with a driver and scheduling the road test.

What did you do particularly well?
Describing the system requirements such as the functional and nonfunctional requirements felt straight forward and made the work on the projects easier to follow along.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would have to choose my diagrams. I felt I got the neccessary items in those but I would like to practice working on proper documentation. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I had broken down the written conversation into tasks looking to be completed. Starting with a Gantt chart and looking at who was assigned to a task made the process easier. 
Breaking down the needs into completable tasks helps me to follow along with what needs are to be met. It's important because the client is the one that wants the system.
Regardles of changes they want made, at the end of the day we are tasked with creating a system that is functional and meets their needs. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I start by writing out what needs to be created followed by working on a rough class diagram. This helps me organize my thoughts and allows the creation process to be less overwhelming.
